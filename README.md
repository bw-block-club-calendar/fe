# Front-end for Block Club Calender

##Day 1
-[ ] Use React and front end styling platforms such as Material UI, Reactstrap, or something like Styled-Components chosen and implemented as your technology choice (to be done and listed during your additions to the Product Canvas)
-[ ] Front end is pulling in some data from backend
-[ ] User Login/Signup Pages built and ready to handle the token being sent between backend and front end
-[ ] React app and Backend App talking to one another, focus on CORS issues

##Day 2

-[ ] 80% of Front end features & UI Components, built and consuming data from the backend (Functionality over form for now)

##Day 3

-[ ] 100% of Front end features & UI Components, built and consuming data from the backend (Now is the time to focus on Form).
-[ ] Front end is pulling in all data necessary from backend, users can interact with ALL CRUD operations on the Project data.

##Day 4
-[ ] Document your projects within the Readme files in their Github repositories. Without having to talk to you specifically, any developer should be able to install, contribute to, and run your project based on the descriptions found in your readme

#MVP

##React I
-[ ] Student created functional components and used events in application to add dynamic functionality to app.
-[ ] Student's code was organized at the component level, proper usage of state and props are demonstrated throughout the project, the UI is composed of small reusable components, proper usage of useState and useEffect hooks are clearly incorporated and correctly implemented.  Student used Array methods to dynamically render HTML elements.
-[ ] Student implemented GET requests using either Axios or Fetch to display 3rd party data on a deployed page. Route management properly installed and used to show top level pages as well as nested views where necessary.
-[ ] Student has set up component management for the forms in the app that makes sense for each form. Student made the decision to use a third-party library, like Formik, or not, and can defend their decision. Some form validation is in place.
-[ ] Student's work demonstrates that all MVP features were built and the student went above and beyond the project.
-[ ] Pair programmed with the Web UI and Back end Architect

###Stretch
-[ ] Student incorperated a third party event/animation library like unto Greensock, Anime, React-motion etc.
-[ ] Student was able to architect components to be easily reused. Student used advanced React techniques like the composition pattern, custom hooks, render props, HOCs, etc.
-[ ] Not only are standard network request techniques employed, the code is organized in such a fashion that the student demonstrated proper use of container vs presentational components or other industry standards, conventions or patterns.
-[ ] Student showed great insight in setting up the state management for the app's forms. Form validation is in place for all fields, and covers all use cases. Loading states and success/error notifications are in place and add to the overall UX of the app.
-[ ] Student's work demonstrates that all MVP features were built and the student went above and beyond the project.
-[ ] Pair programmed with the Web UI and Back end Architect

##React II 
-[ ] React application is deployed and the static landing page is correctly incorporated with the app.
-[ ] CRUD operations drive the application. Each participating student individually created pages that complete all CRUD operations. Token authentication is handled correctly.
-[ ] Student has implemented a state management system that makes sense for the project. It is organized well and implemented correctly. State is not lost as user goes through the application. 
-[ ] Student's work demonstrates that all MVP features were built
-[ ] Team member was collaborative, able to work in a team environment

###Stretch
-[ ] App is deployed, and continuous deployment is set up in a manner that is conducive to a team project environment. Project is organized well on GitHub. Extra considerations were made to help all team members understand how to contribute easily to the project, no matter their role.
-[ ] Pages making HTTP requests do so in a logical manner that is cohesive with the app's state management system. Student showed great care and insight when handling token authentication. Student used a modular system for all requests (e.g. like a  useFetch custom hook).
-[ ] Student showed the ability to manage state in a very coherent system at all levels of the app - global state management, component tree state management, and individual component management. The system is easy to understand and use. Student may have also architected it in such a way that it is reusable for a lot of the state management needs of the app.
-[ ] Student's work demonstrates that all MVP features were built and the student went above and beyond the project.
-[ ] Pair programmed with the Web UI and Back end Architect
